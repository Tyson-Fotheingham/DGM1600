                <h2>About the Creator</h2>

                <p>My name is Tyson Fotheringham. I have decided to creat this website because I really enjoy coding. I have been working on bettering my skills and becoming a "Master Coder" this year in my DGM1600 class. I feel that I have made a great amount of progress when it comes to creating websites. I hope that anyone who is viewing my website will enjoy what I have put together.</p>

            <h2 id="starting">How I ended up in this class...</h2>

            <p>I first started thinking about what I would want to study about 6 months ago when I got home from serving an LDS mission in Peru. I started talking to my cousin who is a UX designer and he recommended that I should learn morea about how to code and design my own websites. <br>I soon became very interested in what the web development classes had to offer. As I have thought about what I should continue to study I have learned there is much to be learned in the world of coding and I am looking forward to increasing my Knowledge as the years go on.</p>
